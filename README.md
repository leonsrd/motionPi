Simple motion detection system with raspberry Pi
------------------------------------------------
motion_capture.py is a simple script that captures live video feed from a raspberry pi camera and detects motion using background subraction. If motion is detected, it saves the frame as a jpeg image and uploads it to a dropbox account. A live feed with a timestamp overlay is also displayed if the raspberry pi is connected to a monitor.
